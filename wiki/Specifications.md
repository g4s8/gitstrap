   *The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).*

Gitsrap works mostly with resource specification yaml documents. Each file should contain at least one document and may contain multiple documents separated by `---` yaml document separator.

Each specification document is a yaml mapping, it consists of these keys:
 - `version` - specification document version
 - `kind` - specification kind
 - `metadata` - specification metadata
 - `spec` - resource specification

Version should be `v2`. Kind is a string which describes the specification kind, it must be one of:
 - [Repository](#Repository)
 - [Organization](#Organization)
 - [WebHook](#WebHook)
 - [Readme](#Readme)
 - [Team](#Team)

A `spec` may have `selector` key to attach to the correct resource.

Metadata is differ for specification, but most of them has these keys:
 - `name` - resource name (e.g. repository name or organization name)
 - `id` - resource ID (e.g. repository, webhook, organization ID)
 - `owner` - resource owner, e.g. repository owner

## Repository

Describes GitHub repository resource, it has:
 - `description` (string) - repository description
 - `homepage` (string) - repository home page URI
 - `defaultBranch` (string, default: `"master"`) - the name of the default branch
 - `mergeStrategy` (list of strings, default: `[merge]`) - pull request merge options, could be one of:
   - `merge` - enable merge commits PR merging
   - `rebase` - enable rebase PR merge
   - `squash` - enable squash PR merge
 - `deleteBranchOnMerge` (bool) - enables delete branch options on PR merge
 - `topics` (list of strings) - repository topics, keywords in GitHub page description
 - `archived` (bool, readonly) - true if repsitory is archived
 - `disabled` (bool, readonly) - true if repository is disabled
 - `license` (string) - license GitHub key, e.g. (`mit`)
 - visibility (string. default: `"public"`) - one of:
   - `public` - repository is public
   - `private` - repository is private
 - `features` (list of strings) - enables repository features:
   - `issues` - enable issues
   - `wiki` - enable wiki pages
   - `pages` - enable GitHub pages
   - `projects` - enable repository project board
   - `downloads` - ???

Repository metadata must specify repository `name`, and may have `owner`, in case if `owner` is not a current user (current user = token owner). When updating existing repository, metadata must contain `id` of the repository. The full metadata could be fetched with `get` command.

Example:
```yaml
version: v2.0-alpha
kind: Repository

    name: gitstrap

    id: 12345
spec:

## Protection

| :memo: Notification|
|:-------------------|
|GitHub uses `fnmatch` syntax for applying protection rules to branches. Github API interacts with protection only for specified branch, i.e. name of protection = name of branch. Therefore if your branch protected by matching syntax e.g. `*`, you can fetch protection, but can not remove via API. Full support of protection  via match available via GitHub web interface.|
